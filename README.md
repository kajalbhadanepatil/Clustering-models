# Clustering-models
This Repository contains mini Machine Learning projects(UnSupervised) completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes, presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
# Introduction
## Unsupervised Machine learning 
Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.
Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 
* Types of Unsupervised Learning:-
  * Clustering
  * Exclusive (partitioning)
  * Agglomerative
  * Overlapping
  * Probabilistic

###  Clustering Types:-

* Hierarchical clustering
* K-means clustering
* Principal Component Analysis
* Singular Value Decomposition
* Independent Component Analysis

# Contents 
* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/kajalbhadanepatil/Clustering-models/blob/main/project_KMeans_teenageMkt.ipynb) -- 
To identify segments of teenagers who share similar tastes and clustering them together
* [Hierarchical clustering](https://github.com/kajalbhadanepatil/Clustering-models/blob/main/project_heirrarcialClustering_TravelReviewSegmentation%20.ipynb) --
Given the google rating data, use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster reviews.

# Technical Aspect 
* This Repository contains Unsupeerwised machine learning Algorithms .
* The models used python as scripting langauge.
* Sklean Library in python used for Clustering Algorithms.
* Data Standerdization done by Sklearn scaler modules.
* Evaluation done by silhouette_score from mertics of sklearn library
